# Stroboscope Using Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

## Overview

This project is a non-contact rotational speed measurement system using a stroboscope built around the **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense**. The system flashes a 9W LED at a controllable frequency. When the flash frequency matches the rotational speed (RPM) of an object, the object appears stationary — allowing accurate RPM estimation.

Multiple control methods are implemented:
- Manual frequency control using a potentiometer
- Gesture-based control using the built-in IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope)
- Bluetooth communication with a smartphone for monitoring and control

## Working Principle

The stroboscope works on the principle of **temporal aliasing**. When the LED flash frequency matches the rotational frequency of the object, it appears still to the eye.

- The **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense** generates PWM pulses to switch a **MOSFET**, which in turn drives a **9W LED**.
- The **MOSFET's gate** requires ~4V, but the 3.7V LiPo battery isn't sufficient, so an **op-amp amplifier** boosts the control signal.
- Flash frequency is adjusted using:
  - A **potentiometer** for coarse manual control
  - The **IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope)** to detect tilts and apply fine adjustments
  - **Bluetooth** to stream frequency/orientation data to a smartphone

## Code Overview

The Arduino code performs the following functions:

- **PWM Signal Generation**: Flashes the 9W LED using a digital output pin.
- **Manual Control**: Reads analog input from the potentiometer to determine base frequency.
- **Gesture Control**: Reads and filters IMU data to allow tilt-based adjustments to flash frequency.
- **Bluetooth Communication**: Sends live frequency and orientation data to a connected smartphone via BLE for monitoring and potential logging.
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combines accelerometer and gyroscope data for smoother gesture control.

## Objectives

- Create a non-contact RPM measurement tool
- Implement both hardware (potentiometer) and motion-based (IMU) input
- Use analog signal amplification for power control (op-amp + MOSFET)
- Add Bluetooth monitoring for wireless interfacing

---

## Outcomes

- Real-time RPM measurement using stroboscopic illusion
- Tilt-controlled frequency adjustment for ease of use
- Successfully integrated BLE for smartphone monitoring
- Built a fully self-contained and portable stroboscope system

## Usage Instructions

1. Power the system with a **3.7V LiPo battery**.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch using the **Arduino IDE**.
3. Adjust the **potentiometer** for initial flash frequency.
4. Use **tilt gestures** (forward/backward/sideways) to fine-tune frequency.
5. Connect your smartphone via **Bluetooth** to receive live frequency and angle data.
6. Point the LED at a rotating object.
7. Tune the flash frequency until the object appears stationary — the frequency now equals the RPM.
